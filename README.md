# Bootstrap-AngularJS-Front-End-Site-
This is a front end site I built during a UI framework course on Coursera
The contents of the site are purely fictional
Install bower before working on the site.
Cut/paste all "Important css related bootstrap files" files to a new folder named 'css'.
Cut/paste all "Images used in the site" files to a new folder named 'images'
